# Observer Design Pattern

The Observer design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows objects to be notified of changes to another object's state. This pattern is useful when you have a set of dependent objects that need to be notified of changes to a source object. By using the Observer pattern, you can avoid tight coupling between the source object and the dependent objects.

## Problem

Consider an application where you have a data model that contains some data that is displayed in a user interface. You want to update the user interface whenever the data model changes. One approach to solving this problem is to tightly couple the data model and the user interface code, so that the user interface is updated whenever the data model changes. However, this approach can lead to code that is difficult to maintain and extend.

## Solution

The Observer pattern provides a solution to the problem of updating dependent objects when a source object changes. The basic idea is to define a set of objects that depend on a source object. Whenever the source object changes, it notifies all of its dependents, allowing them to update their state accordingly.

In the Observer pattern, there are two main components:

- **Subject (or Observable)**: The object that is being observed. This object maintains a list of its dependents, and notifies them whenever its state changes.

- **Observer**: The objects that are dependent on the subject. These objects register themselves with the subject, and are notified whenever the subject's state changes.

Here's a diagram that illustrates the Observer pattern:

In this diagram, the `Subject` maintains a list of `Observers`, and notifies them whenever its state changes.

## Example

Here's an example of how you might use the Observer pattern in Dart to update a user interface when a data model changes:

```dart
// The subject (or observable) that other objects will observe
class DataModel {
  int _value = 0;
  List<Function> _observers = [];

  int get value => _value;

  // Add an observer to the list of observers
  void addObserver(Function observer) {
    _observers.add(observer);
  }

  // Remove an observer from the list of observers
  void removeObserver(Function observer) {
    _observers.remove(observer);
  }

  // Notify all observers that the data model has changed
  void _notifyObservers() {
    for (final observer in _observers) {
      observer(_value);
    }
  }

  // Update the data model's value and notify observers
  void updateValue(int newValue) {
    _value = newValue;
    _notifyObservers();
  }
}

// An observer that listens for changes to the data model
class UserInterface {
  void update(int value) {
    print('Data model updated: $value');
  }
}

void main() {
  final dataModel = DataModel();
  final ui = UserInterface();

  // Add the observer to the data model's list of observers
  dataModel.addObserver(ui.update);

  dataModel.updateValue(42); // prints "Data model updated: 42"

  // Remove the observer from the data model's list of observers
  dataModel.removeObserver(ui.update);
}
```

In this example, the `DataModel` class is the subject that other objects will observe. The `UserInterface` class is the observer that listens for changes to the `DataModel`. When the `DataModel` is updated, it notifies all of its observers by calling their update method with the new value.

To add or remove an observer from the list of observers, the `DataModel` class provides the
