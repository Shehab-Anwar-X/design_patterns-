# Template Method Design Pattern

The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a superclass but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

This pattern is useful when there are similar algorithms with only slight variations in implementation, and you want to avoid duplicating code. By defining the common steps in the superclass and allowing subclasses to provide their own implementation for the differing steps, you can achieve code reusability and maintainability.

## Participants

- **Abstract Class:** Defines the abstract methods that will be implemented by subclasses and provides the template method that calls these methods in a specific order.
- **Concrete Class:** Implements the abstract methods defined by the abstract class to provide their own specific implementation.

## Advantages

- Encourages code reuse by providing a common algorithm structure and allowing subclasses to implement specific variations
- Reduces code duplication and increases maintainability
- Provides a clear separation of concerns between the common algorithm and its variations

## Disadvantages

- Can be inflexible if the structure of the algorithm needs to change, as it can require changes to both the abstract and concrete classes
- Can lead to a large number of subclasses if there are many variations in the algorithm

## Example

An example use case of the Template Method pattern is in the implementation of a web scraper. There may be different websites with different structures and layouts, but the general process of scraping involves the same steps such as sending a request, parsing the HTML, and extracting the desired data.

The abstract class would define the common steps in the scraping algorithm, such as sending the request and parsing the HTML. The concrete classes would then provide their own implementation for extracting the data based on the structure and layout of the specific website being scraped.

## Conclusion

The Template Method design pattern is a useful pattern for achieving code reusability and maintainability by defining a common algorithm structure and allowing subclasses to implement specific variations. It can be used in a variety of situations where similar algorithms with only slight variations in implementation are required.
