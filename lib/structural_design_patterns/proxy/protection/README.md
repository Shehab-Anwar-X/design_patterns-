# Protected Proxy Design Pattern

The protected proxy design pattern is a structural design pattern that adds an additional layer of security to the underlying object. It controls access to the object and filters or modifies its behavior based on the user's authentication and authorization.

## When to use the Protected Proxy Design Pattern?

The protected proxy pattern is used in situations where you need to control access to an object's sensitive data or functionality. It is commonly used in the following situations:

- **Access control**: You can use the protected proxy pattern to control access to sensitive data or methods of an object. The proxy can check the user's authentication and authorization level before allowing them to access the underlying object. It can also filter the data based on the user's access rights.

- **Remote access**: You can use the protected proxy pattern to control access to remote objects. For example, if you have a web service that retrieves sensitive data, you can use a protected proxy to ensure that only authorized clients can access the data.

- **Caching**: You can use the protected proxy pattern to cache the results of expensive or time-consuming operations. The proxy can store the results in memory and return them to the client without re-executing the operation. This can significantly improve performance and reduce server load.

## UML Diagram

The UML class diagram for the protected proxy pattern consists of the following components:

- **Subject**: The base class or interface for the real subject and proxy. It defines the common interface that the client can use to interact with the object.

- **RealSubject**: The actual object that the proxy represents. It performs the actual work that the client wants to do.

- **Proxy**: The proxy object that acts as an intermediary between the client and the real subject. It controls access to the real subject and filters or modifies its behavior based on the user's authentication and authorization.
