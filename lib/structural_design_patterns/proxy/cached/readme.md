# Cached Proxy Design Pattern

The Cached Proxy design pattern is a useful tool for improving the performance and reducing the number of requests made to expensive resources, such as remote APIs, databases, or file systems. The pattern helps by caching the result of previous requests and retrieving them when needed, rather than accessing the resource again.

## Common Use Cases

The Cached Proxy design pattern can be used in various scenarios, including:

### Remote APIs
When an application frequently accesses data from a remote API, the Cached Proxy pattern can cache the data locally and avoid making repeated requests to the API, which can improve performance and reduce the load on the server.

### Database Queries
In applications that make frequent database queries, the Cached Proxy pattern can cache the results of the queries and avoid the overhead of executing the same query multiple times. This can improve performance and reduce the load on the database server.

### File Systems
When an application frequently reads from a file system, the Cached Proxy pattern can cache the contents of the file and avoid the overhead of reading from the file system each time. This can improve performance and reduce the load on the file system.

## Conclusion

The Cached Proxy design pattern is a powerful tool for improving the performance and reducing the number of requests made to expensive resources. It can be used in various scenarios, such as remote APIs, databases, or file systems. By caching the result of previous requests, the pattern can improve performance and reduce the load on the resource.
